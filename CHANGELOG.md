# Homu Release History

This file is the GitHub-facing release log for Homu. Every production release must be documented here and in `lib/changelog.ts` before it is deployed.

## v1.7.0 - May 9, 2026

- Fixed the Add Recurring popup being unusable on iPhones with Dynamic Island. The sheet now respects `env(safe-area-inset-top)` so the close button is reachable, and adopts the same touchmove guard as Add Transaction so the page underneath can no longer scroll while the popup is open.
- Add Transaction popup now uses `h-dvh` (was `h-[95dvh]`) so it fills the screen with no background strip showing underneath, and the footer's bottom padding now respects `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` so the submit button sits a clean distance above the home indicator.
- Replaced the bouncy spring entrance animation on both popups (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`, 380ms) with a smooth Apple-style ease-out (`cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`, 420ms). No more overshoot.
- Renamed `"familyledger"` → `"homu"` in `package.json` (and `package-lock.json`), bumped the service-worker `CACHE_NAME` to `homu-v9`, and replaced the `"e.g. Personal, Family"` ledger-name placeholder with `"e.g. Personal, Homu"` (and the Bahasa version `"mis. Pribadi, Keluarga"` → `"mis. Pribadi, Homu"`) so the brand is consistent everywhere it appears.

## v1.6.0 - May 9, 2026

- Added a branded launch splash to cover the gap between iOS's PWA pre-render and the first paint of the app. Cream background with the Homu icon centred, gentle breathing animation, fades out after ~900ms.
- Switched PWA `theme_color` and `background_color` from `#1a1a1a` / `#f5f0eb` to a unified `#f6f1e9` so the iOS pre-render flash and the splash blend seamlessly with the app's body colour instead of appearing black.

## v1.5.5 - May 9, 2026

- Cropped the bottom navigation's empty white space above the icons. Previously the bar was 72px + safe-area-inset-bottom (~106px on iPhone) tall with icons at bottom: 8px, leaving ~38px of empty white above them. The bar is now a flat 72px with the icon row filling its full height; the bar still reaches the physical bottom of the screen and the home indicator overlays its bottom edge as iOS expects.

## v1.5.4 - May 9, 2026

- Fixed the bottom navigation looking floaty in the installed iPhone PWA. The bar background now fills through `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` to the physical bottom of the screen (previously the whole nav was lifted off the bottom by half the inset, leaving a beige strip below the white). Icons are positioned at `bottom: 8px` and the icon row was tightened from 72px to 60px so they sit just above the home indicator instead of in the middle of the bar.

## v1.5.3 - May 9, 2026

- Fixed the empty white strip below the bottom-nav icons in the installed iPhone PWA. The bar background no longer stretches through the home-indicator safe area; instead the whole nav (background + icons) sits half-way into the inset (~17px above the physical bottom on iPhone, flush on Android/desktop).

## v1.5.2 - May 9, 2026

- Lowered the bottom navigation icons. The gap above the iPhone home indicator was halved (full safe-area inset → half), so Transactions, Add, and Reports sit closer to the physical bottom while still clearing the home indicator.

## v1.5.1 - May 9, 2026

- Fixed the top of every page being hidden behind the iPhone status bar in the installed PWA. The layout, the Reports sticky header, and the Add-to-Home-Screen banner now all respect `env(safe-area-inset-top)` so the profile, ledger switcher, search, and filter buttons are tappable again.

## v1.5.0 - May 9, 2026

- Added the ability to delete a ledger from Settings → Ledger name. Tap the trash icon at the top-right and confirm; the ledger and all of its wallets, categories, transactions, recurring items, and members are permanently removed. The user's only ledger cannot be deleted — they must create or join another first.

## v1.3.4 - May 8, 2026

- Fixed fresh database setup so migrations include wallets, invitations, promo codes, transfer helpers, storage policies, and current security rules.
- Fixed Dashboard balances and Reports totals so they use full ledger history instead of only the first loaded transaction page.
- Fixed Reports wallet filtering so selecting every wallet behaves exactly like All wallets, including older transactions without a wallet.
- Tightened invite-code lookups and promo-code deletion so ledger invites stay private and developers can only delete their own unused promo codes.

## v1.3.3 - May 8, 2026

- Added developer-only deletion for generated promo codes that have not been redeemed yet, with two-tap confirmation.

## v1.3.2 - May 8, 2026

- Replaced the large Reports donut chart with a compact horizontal stacked bar so the breakdown list is visible sooner.
