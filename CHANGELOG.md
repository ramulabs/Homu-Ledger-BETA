# Homu Release History

This file is the GitHub-facing release log for Homu. Every production release must be documented here and in `lib/changelog.ts` before it is deployed.

## v1.5.0 - May 9, 2026

- Added the ability to delete a ledger from Settings → Ledger name. Tap the trash icon at the top-right and confirm; the ledger and all of its wallets, categories, transactions, recurring items, and members are permanently removed. The user's only ledger cannot be deleted — they must create or join another first.

## v1.3.4 - May 8, 2026

- Fixed fresh database setup so migrations include wallets, invitations, promo codes, transfer helpers, storage policies, and current security rules.
- Fixed Dashboard balances and Reports totals so they use full ledger history instead of only the first loaded transaction page.
- Fixed Reports wallet filtering so selecting every wallet behaves exactly like All wallets, including older transactions without a wallet.
- Tightened invite-code lookups and promo-code deletion so ledger invites stay private and developers can only delete their own unused promo codes.

- Added developer-only deletion for generated promo codes that have not been redeemed yet, with two-tap confirmation.
