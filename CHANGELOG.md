# Homu Release History

This file is the GitHub-facing release log for Homu. Every production release must be documented here and in `lib/changelog.ts` before it is deployed.

## v1.7.7 - May 9, 2026

- Final fix for the cream strip below the popup and bottom navigation in the installed iPhone PWA. v1.7.6 set `<html>` bg to `var(--surface)` but `<body>` and the root `<div>` in `(app)/layout.tsx` (which has `bg-[var(--background)]` and `min-h-dvh`) cover the html, so the safe-area zone still showed cream. Added a fixed surface-coloured filler element pinned to `bottom: 0` with `height: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` and `z-0 pointer-events-none`. It sits behind everything (popup z=70, bottom nav z=50) and only paints in the iPhone home-indicator zone — so any element that ends at the visual viewport boundary blends with it.
- Bumped service-worker `CACHE_NAME` to `homu-v14`.

## v1.7.6 - May 9, 2026

- Fixed the cream strip below the bottom navigation bar in the installed iPhone PWA (and the matching "floating bar" flash visible on popup close, which was the same bar appearing momentarily after the popup slid away). Root cause is iOS PWA standalone clipping `position: fixed; bottom: 0` at the *visual* viewport bottom, above the home-indicator safe-area zone — so any element anchored to bottom-0 (bottom nav, sheet wrappers) ends above the physical screen bottom and the html element's bg shows through in that strip. Globals.css now sets `html { background: var(--surface) }` and `body { background: var(--background) }` separately. The strip is therefore the same surface colour as the bottom nav and the popup sheets, making it invisible — without needing fragile bottom-extension hacks that broke scroll in v1.7.4.

## v1.7.5 - May 9, 2026

- Reverted v1.7.4's `bottom: -env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` hack on the sheet wrapper — it was extending the sheet past the visual viewport, which broke scroll inside the form (only the submit button responded to touch) and pushed the footer off-screen. Standard `fixed inset-0` is back.
- New approach for the cream strip below the popup: while the sheet is open, set `document.documentElement.style.backgroundColor = var(--surface)`. iOS PWA standalone renders the home-indicator safe-area zone using the `<html>` element's bg, so when the sheet is open the safe-area zone is the same colour as the sheet (no visible strip). The colour is reset 420ms after close (after the slide-out animation finishes).
- Bumped service-worker `CACHE_NAME` to `homu-v12`.

## v1.7.4 - May 9, 2026

- iOS PWA standalone evidently clips `position: fixed; bottom: 0` at the visual viewport boundary (above the home-indicator safe-area zone), leaving a strip of page background visible below the popup even with the v1.7.2/v1.7.3 wrapper-pattern + `h-full` approach. Added inline style `bottom: calc(0px - env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` on the slide-animated outer wrapper of both Add Transaction and Add Recurring sheets so the box (and therefore its bg) extends past the visual viewport bottom into the home-indicator zone.
- Bumped service-worker `CACHE_NAME` to `homu-v11` so the new chunks load on relaunch.

## v1.7.3 - May 9, 2026

- Forced explicit `h-full` on the inner sheet card (Add Transaction + Add Recurring) so its `bg-[var(--surface)]` reaches the very bottom of the iPhone screen. v1.7.2's wrapper relied on flexbox `align-items: stretch` (the default), which evidently wasn't always extending the inner card through the home-indicator zone on iOS PWA standalone.
- Bumped service-worker `CACHE_NAME` from `homu-v9` to `homu-v10` to force eviction of any stale `_next/static` chunks so the new sheet structure actually loads on first launch after the deploy.

## v1.7.2 - May 9, 2026

- Restructured Add Transaction and Add Recurring sheets so the white surface bg actually reaches every edge of the iPhone screen. The slide-animated wrapper is now `fixed inset-0` (definitely covers the viewport in all iOS PWA standalone configurations); the actual sheet card is a flex child inside that wrapper, max-width-constrained, stretching to full height. v1.7.1's `inset-y-0` direct approach didn't reliably extend through the home-indicator safe area on iOS PWA.
- Body-scroll unlock + scroll-position restore is now deferred until after the 420ms slide-out animation finishes (was firing immediately on close, which caused the page underneath to visibly jump while the sheet was still animating away).

## v1.7.1 - May 9, 2026

- Fixed the Add Transaction and Add Recurring popups not reaching the bottom of the iPhone screen, and the close animation flashing the page background strip during slide-out. The sheets now use `inset-y-0` (top:0 bottom:0) instead of `bottom-0 + h-dvh` — `h-dvh` was reporting shorter than the full viewport on iOS PWA standalone mode, leaving the safe-area zone uncovered.

## v1.7.0 - May 9, 2026

- Fixed the Add Recurring popup being unusable on iPhones with Dynamic Island. The sheet now respects `env(safe-area-inset-top)` so the close button is reachable, and adopts the same touchmove guard as Add Transaction so the page underneath can no longer scroll while the popup is open.
- Add Transaction popup now uses `h-dvh` (was `h-[95dvh]`) so it fills the screen with no background strip showing underneath, and the footer's bottom padding now respects `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` so the submit button sits a clean distance above the home indicator.
- Replaced the bouncy spring entrance animation on both popups (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`, 380ms) with a smooth Apple-style ease-out (`cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`, 420ms). No more overshoot.
- Renamed `"familyledger"` → `"homu"` in `package.json` (and `package-lock.json`), bumped the service-worker `CACHE_NAME` to `homu-v9`, and replaced the `"e.g. Personal, Family"` ledger-name placeholder with `"e.g. Personal, Homu"` (and the Bahasa version `"mis. Pribadi, Keluarga"` → `"mis. Pribadi, Homu"`) so the brand is consistent everywhere it appears.

## v1.6.0 - May 9, 2026

- Added a branded launch splash to cover the gap between iOS's PWA pre-render and the first paint of the app. Cream background with the Homu icon centred, gentle breathing animation, fades out after ~900ms.
- Switched PWA `theme_color` and `background_color` from `#1a1a1a` / `#f5f0eb` to a unified `#f6f1e9` so the iOS pre-render flash and the splash blend seamlessly with the app's body colour instead of appearing black.

## v1.5.5 - May 9, 2026

- Cropped the bottom navigation's empty white space above the icons. Previously the bar was 72px + safe-area-inset-bottom (~106px on iPhone) tall with icons at bottom: 8px, leaving ~38px of empty white above them. The bar is now a flat 72px with the icon row filling its full height; the bar still reaches the physical bottom of the screen and the home indicator overlays its bottom edge as iOS expects.

## v1.5.4 - May 9, 2026

- Fixed the bottom navigation looking floaty in the installed iPhone PWA. The bar background now fills through `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` to the physical bottom of the screen (previously the whole nav was lifted off the bottom by half the inset, leaving a beige strip below the white). Icons are positioned at `bottom: 8px` and the icon row was tightened from 72px to 60px so they sit just above the home indicator instead of in the middle of the bar.

## v1.5.3 - May 9, 2026

- Fixed the empty white strip below the bottom-nav icons in the installed iPhone PWA. The bar background no longer stretches through the home-indicator safe area; instead the whole nav (background + icons) sits half-way into the inset (~17px above the physical bottom on iPhone, flush on Android/desktop).

## v1.5.2 - May 9, 2026

- Lowered the bottom navigation icons. The gap above the iPhone home indicator was halved (full safe-area inset → half), so Transactions, Add, and Reports sit closer to the physical bottom while still clearing the home indicator.

## v1.5.1 - May 9, 2026

- Fixed the top of every page being hidden behind the iPhone status bar in the installed PWA. The layout, the Reports sticky header, and the Add-to-Home-Screen banner now all respect `env(safe-area-inset-top)` so the profile, ledger switcher, search, and filter buttons are tappable again.

## v1.5.0 - May 9, 2026

- Added the ability to delete a ledger from Settings → Ledger name. Tap the trash icon at the top-right and confirm; the ledger and all of its wallets, categories, transactions, recurring items, and members are permanently removed. The user's only ledger cannot be deleted — they must create or join another first.

## v1.3.4 - May 8, 2026

- Fixed fresh database setup so migrations include wallets, invitations, promo codes, transfer helpers, storage policies, and current security rules.
- Fixed Dashboard balances and Reports totals so they use full ledger history instead of only the first loaded transaction page.
- Fixed Reports wallet filtering so selecting every wallet behaves exactly like All wallets, including older transactions without a wallet.
- Tightened invite-code lookups and promo-code deletion so ledger invites stay private and developers can only delete their own unused promo codes.

## v1.3.3 - May 8, 2026

- Added developer-only deletion for generated promo codes that have not been redeemed yet, with two-tap confirmation.

## v1.3.2 - May 8, 2026

- Replaced the large Reports donut chart with a compact horizontal stacked bar so the breakdown list is visible sooner.
