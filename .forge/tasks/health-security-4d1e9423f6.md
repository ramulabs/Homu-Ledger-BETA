## Finding

**Source:** Security · OWASP A01 (Broken Access Control)  
**File:** `app/api/auth-log/route.ts:1`  
**Severity:** warning

## Description

The `/api/auth-log` route handler accepts POST requests without any authentication check. The endpoint logs user-supplied fields (`fromPath`, `isStandalone`, `hiddenMs`, `note`) to the server console:

```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  let payload: Payload | null = null;
  try {
    payload = (await request.json()) as Payload;
  } catch { }
  // ... logs payload to console — no auth guard
}
```

Any unauthenticated client can:
- Flood Vercel runtime logs with fake diagnostic entries, obscuring real logout events the endpoint was designed to capture
- Probe which fields are logged to infer what diagnostic metadata the platform captures

The intentional design (no DB write, log only) reduces severity, but the endpoint serves as a signal about internal observability infrastructure.

## Recommended Fix

Add a lightweight session check using the Supabase server client. If no session, return 401 and skip logging. The client-side caller already has a Supabase session when it fires this endpoint (the bounce only happens from authenticated pages):

```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const supabase = await createClient();
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (!user) return new NextResponse(null, { status: 401 });
  // ... rest of logging logic
}
```

Alternatively, a signed HMAC token generated client-side from the session JWT would work without a Supabase round-trip on the edge runtime.
