Repro:

1. Open Add Transaction sheet.
2. Tap the category row → bento picker opens.
3. Tap "New category" → fill in name/icon/color → Save.
4. The new category is created, but the entire Add Transaction sheet also closes.
5. User has to reopen Add Transaction and re-enter amount / description / wallet / date.

Expected:

After creating the new category, the picker closes, the new category is preselected on the still-open Add Transaction sheet, and the user can hit Save on the transaction they were building.

Probable root cause: `add-category-sheet` is calling its `onClose` after success, which the parent (Add Transaction) interprets as a request to close too — or the dismiss event bubbles. Needs scoped close handler that targets only the category picker stack.

Companion to **ram-22** (redesign + audit pass).
